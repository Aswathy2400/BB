### Project Description 
Gift Box Surprise is an interactive web app where users choose virtual gift boxes that reveal fun surprises—like quotes, activities, or a playful hacking animation. It combines engaging visuals, sound effects, and a retro hacker theme for an entertaining experience.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
In a world full of predictable web pages, users suffer from a lack of surprise, suspense, and pure digital fun. There's no excitement in clicking buttons that just work as expected. What’s missing? A quirky, unpredictable experience—one that brings back joy, mystery, and a hint of chaos.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
We built a webpage where clicking a gift box could launch a mini-game, play a sound, display a quote, or fake-hack your screen. Why? Because why not. It's surprise, suspense, and silliness—all wrapped in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Finally, a solution to a problem nobody had… but everyone secretly enjoys.
